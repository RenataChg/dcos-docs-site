# Version 2.2.1-1.13.4

## Breaking Changes from 1.x

* DC/OS Kubernetes `2.2.1-1.13.4` requires DC/OS 1.12.
* DC/OS Kubernetes `2.2.1-1.13.4` introduces breaking changes to the way the package works and is deployed.
  Therefore, it is not possible to upgrade an existing installation of DC/OS Kubernetes to `2.2.1-1.13.4`.
* Before installing `kubernetes-cluster` package `2.2.1-1.13.4`, the `kubernetes` package must be [installed and running](/services/kubernetes/2.2.1-1.13.4/getting-started/installing-mke/).
* It is no longer possible to install DC/OS Kubernetes on DC/OS Enterprise without specifying a [service account](/1.12/security/ent/service-auth/) and a service account secret with adequate [permissions](/1.12/security/ent/perms-reference/).
* Package options have been renamed and re-organized.
  * `node_placement` renamed to `private_node_placement`
  * `reserved_resources` renamed to `private_reserved_resources`
  * `control_plane_reserved_resources` contains the combined resources from previous `1.x` options `apiserver`, `controller_manager` and `scheduler` and `2.0.0-1.12.0-beta` options `control_plane_cpus`, `control_plane_mem` and `control_plane_disk` were moved to under this group.

## Improvements

* Kubernetes v1.13.4
* Docker v18.09.3
* Calico v3.5.2
* Support for Mesos pre-reserved roles for etcd, control-plane, public-node and private-node, and placement rules for etcd.
* Modify how etcd placement constraints are defined, there is now a separate `etcd.placement` option. For backwards compatibility, if it's left empty the value from `kubernetes.control_plane_placement` will be used.

## Bug Fixes

* Fix a bug where sometimes Kubernetes workloads running on public agents would not have access to Kubernetes workloads running on private agents.
* Fix a bug where using `--path-to-custom-ca` in `dcos kubernetes cluster kubeconfig` resulted in an improperly encoded `certificate-authority-data` in the generated `kubeconfig` file.

## Documentation

* Fix the [`etcd` snapshotting](/services/kubernetes/2.2.1-1.13.4/operations/troubleshooting/) instructions.
* Add section `Mesos Roles` to `Advanced Installation` page.

## Known Issues

Known issues and limitations are listed in the [Limitations](/services/kubernetes/2.2.1-1.13.4/limitations/) page.
