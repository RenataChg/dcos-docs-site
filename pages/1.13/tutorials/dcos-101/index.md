This introduction to DC/OS tutorial covers the following basic tasks:

- how to install
- how to configure
- how to view

If you are setting up a demonstration environment as a proof-of-concept for testing or evaluation purposes or creating a small cluster for application development or a specific project, you can use the steps in this tutorial to get started using DC/OS. 

For a production environment or larger scale deployment, additional planning and deployment steps are required. For example, you might have superuser permissions to simplify security requirements in a demonstration environment or small cluster.

# Intended audience
This tutorial provides users and application developers an overview of DC/OS basics, including the steps required to deploy and orchestrate a few sample applications in a distributed cluster environment.

After completing this tutorial, you will have hands-on experience deploying multiple applications on a cluster. Along the way, the tutorial also suggests links to additional documentation for background or more detailed information into related topics for you to explore further.

# What you'll find
This section contains tutorials for working with DC/OS Open Source and Enterprise clusters. Each tutorial illustrates how to accomplish a specific goal. In most cases, each goal involves a sequence of steps. In a production environment, you might need to perform additional steps or choose to perform these steps in a different order.
