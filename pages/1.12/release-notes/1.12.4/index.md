# About DC/OS 1.12 
DC/OS 1.12 includes many new features and capabilities. The key features and enhancements focus on:
- [Mesosphere Kubernetes engine](#kubernetes)
- [Mesosphere Jupyter service](#jupyter)
- [Observability and metrics](#observe-metrics)
- [Private package registry](#private-reg)
- [Installation and upgrade improvements](#install)
- [LDAP and networking enhancements](#ldap-net)

<a name="kubernetes"></a>

### Mesosphere Kubernetes engine
- Introduced High Density Multi-Kubernetes (HDMK) that allows operators to take advantage of intelligent resource pooling when running multiple Kubernetes clusters on DC/OS. Compared with other Kubernetes distributions that run a single Kubernetes node per virtual machine, Mesosphere HDMK uses its intelligent resource pooling to pack multiple Kubernetes nodes onto the same server for bare metal, virtual machine, and public cloud instances, driving significant cost savings and resource efficiencies. [Learn more about Kubernetes on DC/OS](/services/kubernetes/2.0.0-1.12.1/).

<a name="jupyter"></a>

### Mesosphere Jupyter service (MJS)
- Delivered secure, [cloud-native Jupyter](https://docs.mesosphere.com/services/beta-jupyter/) Notebooks-as-a-Service to empower data scientists to perform analytics and distributed machine learning on elastic GPU-pools with access to big and fast data services.
- Secured connectivity to data lakes and data sets on S3 and (Kerberized) HDFS.
- Included GPU-enabled Spark and distributed TensorFlow.
- Provided OpenID connect authentication and authorization with support for Windows Integrated Authentication (WIA) and Active Directory Federation Services (ADFS).

<a name="observe-metrics"></a>

### Observability and metrics
- Introduced a flexible and configurable metrics pipeline with multiple output formats.
- Enhanced support for application metric types including histograms, counters, timers, and gauges.
- Provided support for sample rates and multi-metrics packets. 
- Introduced Mesos [framework metrics](http://mesos.apache.org/documentation/latest/monitoring/#frameworks).
- No longer require modifications when collecting metrics via Prometheus endpoint in 1.11.

<a name="private-reg"></a>

[enterprise]
### Private package registry
[/enterprise]
- Enabled [on-premise package distribution and management](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.12/administering-clusters/repo/package-registry/).
- Enabled air-gapped Virtual Private Cloud package management.
- Simplified package artifact management.
- Introduced package-specific controls for adding/removing/updating packages within a cluster.
- Introduced package management CLI.

<a name="install"></a>

### Installation and upgrade
- Provided full support for installing and operating a cluster on SELinux hardened OS with SE Linux in targeted-enforcing mode for all hardened non-DC/OS components.
- Introduced a unified Terraform-based open source tool for provisioning, deploying, installing, upgrading, and decommissioning DC/OS on AWS, GCP, and Azure.
- Introduced an intuitive, streamlined installation with a quick start process - Spin up a DC/OS cluster with a few easy steps in 10-15 minutes. 
- Officially recommended as a Mesosphere supported installation method with best practices built-in (i.e sequential masters & parallel agents in upgrade).
- Restructured [Mesosphere installation documentation](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.12/installing/evaluation/) to organize Mesosphere supported installation methods and Community supported installation methods.
- Expanded DC/OS upgrade paths enable Mesosphere to skip specific [upgrade paths](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.12/installing/production/upgrading/#supported-upgrade-paths) within a supported patch version of DC/OS (i.e upgrade from 1.11.1 => 1.11.5 in one move) and to skip upgrade paths between supported major to major versions of DC/OS (for example, enabling you to upgrade from 1.11.7 to 1.12.1 in one move).
- If you have installed the optional DC/OS Storage Service package, then upgrading from 1.12.0 to 1.12.1 requires you to first follow the storage upgrade instructions provided in [Manually upgrade the DSS package to 0.5.x from 0.4.x](/services/beta-storage/0.5.2-beta/upgrades/). 

<p class="message--note"><strong>NOTE: </strong>You must upgrade DC/OS storage before you upgrade cluster nodes to 1.12.1 to prevent Mesos agents from crashing after the upgrade.</p>


<a name="ldap-net"></a>

[enterprise]
### LDAP and networking enhancements
[/enterprise]
- Introduced anonymous LDAP bind complies with standardized Enterprise LDAP integration pattern without a dedicated DC/OS integration LDAP user.
- Provided dynamic LDAP synchronization to synchronize [LDAP user account groups](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.12/security/ent/users-groups/) automatically without manual synchronization of [LDAP directory](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.12/security/ent/ldap/) with accounts imported into DC/OS.
- Enhanced networking component with 150+ bug fixes with limited logging for visibility.
- Improved DNS convergence time (sub-sec) performance.
- Configured MTU for Overlay networks.
- Provided reusable IP addresses for new agents in the cluster.
- Mitigation of networking stuck-state due to SSL deadlock in Erlang library.
- Provided TLS 1.2 support.
- Provided support for per container network Metrics.
- Leveraged persistent connections in Edge-LB for L7 load-balancing. [enterprise type="inline" size="small" /]
- Improved logging in Edge-LB. [enterprise type="inline" size="small" /]
