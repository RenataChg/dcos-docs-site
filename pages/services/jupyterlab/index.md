Welcome to the documentation for DC/OS {{ model.techName }} services. Please select a version from the left hand menu to get started.

{{ model.techName }} is the next-generation interface for Project Jupyter, offering the same tools that are familiar to Jupyter Notebook users: terminal, text editor, notebook, file browser, and so forth. Users can work with text editors, terminals, data file viewers, and other components in a notebook with tabbed work areas.
