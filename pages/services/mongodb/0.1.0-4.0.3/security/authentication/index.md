{{  model.techName  }} OpsManager provides support to enable authentication and authorization of users. This helps to ensure security of the servers by enabling access control. If a deployment uses access control, the Monitoring and Backup Agents must authenticate to the deployment as {{  model.techName  }} users with appropriate access. With access control enabled, you must create {{  model.techName  }} users so that clients can access your databases.

If you are using automation to manage your {{  model.techName  }} deployments, Ops Manager automatically creates users for the agents when you enable access control. The user created for the Automation Agent has privileges to administrate and manage other users. As such, the first user you create can have any role.

# Configuring {{  model.techName  }} Authentication
1. In the project dashboard of {{  model.techName  }} OpsManager, click on the **Security** tab.

    Figure 2. - **Authentication & TLS/SSL** option under **Security**

1. Click on the **Edit Settings** option. A pop-up dialog will appear as **Authentication & TLS/SSL Settings**.

1. Enable the ```Username/Password (MONGODB-CR/SCRAM-SHA-1)``` Authentication mechanism by ticking the check-box against the option.

1. Click **Next** to continue to the next screen. Keep the **Configure TLS/SSL** parameter in the default state of `Disabled` (since TLS is not supported in this release).

    Figure 9. - Connect to replica set with Authentication

1. In order to connect to the Replica Set and access the `mongo` shell, you must connect to the DC/OS {{  model.techName  }} task.
To enter the DC/OS {{  model.techName  }} task shell, execute the following command over DC/OS CLI:

    ```bash
      dcos task exec -ti <dcos-task-id> bash
    ```

1. Enter the command to connect with the Replica Set in the CLI instance to access the `mongo` shell using authentication mechanism.
